💻 Vinicius Moura: CS Graduate & Systems Developer

👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a highly driven Developer with a robust academic foundation and intensive, project-based training. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Dublin Business School (DBS) and I am actively progressing through the 42 Common Core curriculum.

My specialization lies in technical precision and systems-level logic. I utilize a strong fundamental knowledge base (C, C++, OOP, and Algorithms) to build and optimize low-level software solutions.

🎓 Education & Specialized Training

    42 Common Core Student | 42 Network

        Currently advancing through the rigorous curriculum, focusing on C, UNIX systems programming, concurrency, manual memory management, and low-level software architecture.

    Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science | Dublin Business School (DBS)

        Focus: Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Software Engineering principles.

    42 Porto Piscine Graduate | 42 Network

        Successfully completed the demanding entry-level coding bootcamp, validating technical rigor and adaptability.

🛠️ Core Technical Competencies

Category	Skills & Focus
Programming Languages	Proficient in C, C++, C#, and Java, with introductory experience in Python.
Technical Fundamentals	Algorithms, Data Structures, OOP, Manual Memory Management, and Clean Code Practices.
Development Tools	Git for version control; IDEs/Editors including Visual Studio, CLion, IntelliJ, and VS Code.
Professional Experience	Experience working across North America and Europe in technology and business-focused roles.

💡 Highlight Projects (Systems Programming)

These projects demonstrate advanced proficiency in concurrency, low-level resource handling, and systems programming:

    Minishell: A custom command-line interpreter built in C. This project involved implementing process creation (fork/exec), I/O redirection, piping, and environment variable handling, showcasing deep knowledge of UNIX system calls.

    Philosophers: An implementation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" concurrency problem using pthreads (POSIX threads). This project focused heavily on thread synchronization, use of mutexes, and advanced deadlock prevention strategies.

    libft: My personal standard C library, meticulously built from scratch to ensure complete mastery of string and memory manipulation at the function level.

Currently expanding my portfolio within the 42 Common Core, with upcoming projects focused on networking and advanced systems concepts.
